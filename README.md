## Overview

This is a solution to the [Results summary component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/results-summary-component-CE_K6s0maV). It aims to create a visually appealing and visually as close as possible to the original order summary component.

### The challenge

This project is a solution for the "Results summary component" challenge from Frontend Mentor. The challenge required the creation of a results summary component with the following specifications:

- The component should display the user's test results, including a score and an accompanying message.
- The upper section of the component should have a blue background and display the result title, score, and hooray message.
- The lower section should include a summary title and four rectangular boxes representing different categories, each containing an icon, category title, and corresponding score.
- Each rectangular box should have a distinct color scheme.
- The component should be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.
- The HTML code provided includes the necessary structure for the component, including the main container div, the upper and bottom sections, and the individual elements for the results summary.

The CSS code provided contains the styles for the component, including the layout, colors, typography, and responsiveness. It defines the appearance of each element within the component, such as the background gradients, font weights, and padding.

The project also includes a favicon and separate CSS files for resetting default styles and applying custom styles.

In the desktop version, the component is displayed as a rectangular container with the upper and bottom sections side by side. The upper section has a fixed width and height, while the bottom section is responsive and adjusts its margin and padding.

Overall, this solution fulfills the requirements of the "Results summary component" challenge and provides a visually appealing and responsive component for displaying test results.

## My process

### Built with

  CSS: Applied styles to enhance the visual presentation and layout of the order summary card.
- Visual Studio Code: A powerful and popular code editor that provided a convenient and efficient development environment.

### What I learned

Throughout the development of this project, I gained valuable knowledge and skills. Here are some key things I learned:

- HTML structure: I gained experience in creating the structure of a web page using HTML. I learned how to organize elements such as headings, paragraphs, and div containers to establish the layout of the order summary card.

- CSS styling: I learned how to apply CSS styles to enhance the visual presentation of the order summary card. This included styling text, backgrounds, borders, and utilizing CSS selectors and properties to achieve the desired design.

### Continued development

I aspire to dive deeper into CSS and explore more advanced techniques and concepts. This includes mastering CSS Grid, learning CSS animations and transitions, and exploring responsive design patterns to create truly dynamic and interactive user interfaces. With the increasing use of mobile devices, it's crucial to create websites that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes. I want to focus on mastering responsive design principles and adopting a mobile-first approach, ensuring that my projects are accessible and provide a great user experience across all devices.
